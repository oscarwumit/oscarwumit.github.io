Abstract

Stress testing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) is an important tool used to gauge chemical stability and identify potential degradation products. While different flavors of API stress testing systems have been used in experimental investigations for decades, the detailed kinetics of such systems as well as the chemical composition of prominent reactive species, specifically reactive oxygen species, are unknown. As a first step toward understanding and modeling API oxidation in stress testing, we investigated a typical radical “soup” solution an API is subject to during stress testing. Here we applied _ab initio electronic structure calculations_ to automatically generate and refine a detailed chemical kinetics model, taking a fresh look at API oxidation. We generated a detailed kinetic model for a representative azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN)/H<sub>2</sub>O/CH3OH stress-testing system with a varied cosolvent ratio (50%/50%–99.5%/0.5% vol water/methanol) for 5.0 mM AIBN and representative pH values of 4–10 at 40 °C that was stirred and open to the atmosphere. At acidic conditions, hydroxymethyl alkoxyl is the dominant alkoxyl radical, and at basic conditions, for most studied initial methanol concentrations, cyanoisopropyl alkoxyl becomes the dominant alkoxyl radical, albeit at an overall lower concentration. At acidic conditions, the levels of cyanoisopropyl peroxyl, hydroxymethyl peroxyl, and hydroperoxyl radicals are relatively high and comparable, while, at both neutral and basic pH conditions, superoxide becomes the prominent radical in the system. The present work reveals the prominent species in a common model API stress testing system at various cosolvent and pH conditions, sets the stage for an in-depth quantitative API kinetic study, and demonstrates the usage of novel software tools for automated chemical kinetic model generation and _ab initio_ refinement.
